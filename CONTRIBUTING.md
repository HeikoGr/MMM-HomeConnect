-# Contributing (short)

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Here are simple steps:

1) Open an issue
- Describe what you expected and what happened.
- Add steps to reproduce and any logs (PM2 or browser console).

2) Make a branch and a PR
- Fork, create a branch like `fix/short-desc` or `feat/short-desc`.
- Write a clear PR description: problem, solution, how to test.

3) Test locally
- In the module folder run: `npm ci`.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:spelling`.

4) Style
- Use ESLint and Prettier (see `package.json` scripts).

5) PR checklist
- Does `npm run lint` pass?
- Is README updated if needed?
- Did you add test steps in the PR?

If unsure, open an issue first.
